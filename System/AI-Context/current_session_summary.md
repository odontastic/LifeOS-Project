I have updated the To-Do list (`System/AI-Context/session_tasks.md`) to fully align with the `LifeOS_Agentic_AI_Coder_Master_Instructions_25-12-13.md`.

**Key updates to the To-Do list:**

*   **Database Choices:** Tasks [P_02] (Implement database models) and [P_21] (Implement Latent Semantic Graph) have been updated to explicitly use **ArangoDB** for graph data, replacing Neo4j. Task [P_25] (Enhance Database Security) has been updated to remove Redis-specific tasks and focus on Qdrant and ArangoDB.
*   **Event-First Design:** Task [P_04] has been updated to specify implementing the `EmotionContextBus` using a **SQLite-backed append-only event log** as per the Master Instructions.
*   **Non-Goals Compliance:** Task [P_28] (Android Development Plan) has been **cancelled**, as mobile-native apps are explicitly defined as a non-goal in the Master Instructions.

The To-Do list now accurately reflects the project's updated technical and architectural direction.

I am awaiting your next instruction.
