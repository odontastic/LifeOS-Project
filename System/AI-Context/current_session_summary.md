I have completed task **[P_05] Implement the `/emotion/log`, `/emotion/retrieve`, `/emotion/analyze` API endpoints for `Inner Palette`.**

The next pending task in the To-Do list is:
**[P_06] Develop UI components for multi-modal emotion capture (categorical, dimensional, somatic, narrative) for the web frontend.**

However, my current role is focused on the **backend implementation** of the LifeOS application (within `apps/backend/lifeos-rag-api`). Developing UI components for the web frontend (`apps/frontend/LifeOS-Web`) is outside my current operational scope as a backend-focused agent.

Would you like me to:
1.  **Skip this frontend task** for now and proceed with the next pending backend-related task?
2.  **Provide a high-level plan** for implementing these frontend UI components (though I cannot implement them directly)?
3.  **Receive new instructions** on how you would like me to proceed?
