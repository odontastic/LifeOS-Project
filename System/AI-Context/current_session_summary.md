I have successfully executed `git push origin main`. Your local `main` branch is now up to date with `origin/main`.

All pending changes have been published to the remote repository.

The `git status` output still shows one untracked file:
`System/AI-Context/current_session_summary25-12-13.md`

Could you please confirm if you want me to ignore this file (e.g., add it to `.gitignore`) or if it's an important file that needs to be committed?
