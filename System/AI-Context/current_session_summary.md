I have successfully committed the `LifeOS_Agentic_AI_Coder_Master_Instructions_25-12-13.md` file and the updated session summaries.

The `git status` output currently shows one untracked file:
`System/AI-Context/current_session_summary25-12-13.md`

This file was not created by me. It appears to be a separate session summary or temporary file.

Could you please confirm if you want me to ignore this file (e.g., add it to `.gitignore`) or if it's an important file that needs to be committed?
