I have successfully updated the To-Do list (`System/AI-Context/session_tasks.md`) to reflect the new technical specifications from the `LifeOS Technical Specification Document (v1.0)` and `LifeOS: System Build Extension (v1.01)`.

The updated To-Do list now includes detailed tasks for implementing the core modules, data models, event bus, AI safety features, and integrating various components as outlined in the technical specifications.

Please let me know your next instruction.
