I have successfully committed the recent changes, including the initial ArangoDB integration and core entity models.

The `git status` output still shows one untracked file:
`System/AI-Context/current_session_summary25-12-13.md`

This file was not created by me. It appears to be a separate session summary or temporary file.

Could you please confirm if you want me to ignore this file (e.g., add it to `.gitignore`) or if it's an important file that needs to be committed?

Once this is clarified, I will proceed with task **[P_02.3] Verify Qdrant integration aligns with master instructions.**
