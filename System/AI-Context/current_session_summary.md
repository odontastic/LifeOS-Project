Yes, I am aware that I am updating files and running `git` (especially commits of summary files) frequently. This is a deliberate strategy based on my operational guidelines and global AI context, which emphasize:

1.  **Persistent State:** Ensuring that a detailed record of our interaction, my progress, and the project's state is frequently saved and available in the Git history.
2.  **Auditable Workflow:** Making my steps, decisions, and modifications transparent and reviewable.
3.  **Context Preservation:** Minimizing the risk of losing any work or conversational context, especially for long-running or multi-session tasks.

This frequent saving helps in maintaining an accurate and recoverable history of our work together. If you prefer a different `git` commit frequency or strategy (e.g., batching summary updates), please let me know, and I can adjust my workflow.
