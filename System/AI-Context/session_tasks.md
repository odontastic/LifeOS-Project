- [completed] Verify and scaffold the FastAPI application structure inside `apps/backend/lifeos-rag-api/`.
- [completed] Establish dependency management with pinned versions in `requirements.txt`.
- [completed] Set up configuration management using a `.env` file.
- [completed] Create `lifeos-rag-api/models` directory.
- [completed] For each schema in `temp_schemas/`, create a corresponding Pydantic model (`zettel.py`, `project.py`, etc.) in `lifeos-rag-api/models`.
- [completed] Create a core module for the event-sourcing system.
- [completed] Define a generic `Event` model (Pydantic) with `event_id`, `event_type`, `timestamp`, `payload`, and `schema_version`.
- [completed] Implement a service that writes events to a dedicated, append-only SQLite table (`event_log`).
- [completed] Create a `lifeos-rag-api/routers` directory.
- [completed] For each resource type, create a dedicated router file (e.g., `routers/zettel.py`).
- [completed] Implement all CRUD endpoints (`POST`, `GET`, `PUT`, `DELETE`) as specified in `System/Documentation/Backend_Endpoints.md`.
- [completed] Implement Command Logic (POST, PUT, DELETE endpoints) to generate and log appropriate events to the event bus.
- [completed] Implement Query Logic (GET endpoints) with a state reconstruction service and read-model tables.
- [completed] Define Read Models (SQLAlchemy) for each resource type in `apps/backend/lifeos-rag-api/src/event_sourcing/read_models.py`.
- [completed] Implement Event Processor in `apps/backend/lifeos-rag-api/src/event_sourcing/event_processor.py`.
- [completed] Integrate Event Processor into `main.py` and update GET endpoints.
- [completed] Implement the JWT-based local authentication system.
- [completed] Create endpoints for user registration and login.
- [completed] Secure all data-related endpoints, ensuring they are scoped to the authenticated user.
- [completed] Set up a `tests/` directory.
- [in_progress] Write tests covering event creation/replay, state reconstruction, API validation/security, index rebuild, and graceful degradation.
- [completed] Test Event Creation and Replay.
- [completed] Test API Validation.
- [pending] Test API Security.
- [pending] Test Index Rebuild.
- [pending] Test Graceful Degradation.
- [pending] Create a `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` to run the FastAPI backend and its dependent services.
- [pending] Ensure the FastAPI OpenAPI documentation is complete and accessible.
- [pending] Update the main project `README.md` with build, configure, and run instructions.
