# Contexts

This directory contains context-based organization for the GTD methodology. Contexts represent the different situations or resources needed to complete tasks, enabling efficient action execution based on current circumstances.

## Available Contexts

### Core Contexts
- [**@Computer**](@Computer.md) - Actions requiring computer access (research, development, documentation)
- [**@Home**](@Home.md) - Home-based activities (repairs, personal care, household tasks)
- [**@Shopping**](@Shopping.md) - Purchasing and procurement activities
- [**@Calls**](@Calls.md) - Phone calls and voice communication
- [**@Personal**](@Personal.md) - Personal care and individual activities
- [**@Cleaning**](@Cleaning.md) - Cleaning and maintenance tasks
- [**@Organization**](@Organization.md) - Sorting, categorizing, and system setup

## Structure
- Each context has its own markdown file describing the context and related activities
- Next actions are organized in the 05-NextActions/ directory by context
- Contexts enable filtering actions by current situation, time, energy, and resources

## Usage
- Review context files to understand what types of actions belong in each context
- Use contexts to quickly identify actions you can do right now
- Combine context filtering with time/energy/priority criteria for optimal action selection
