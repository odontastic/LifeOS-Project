# Project: John's 6th Grade Life Science Curriculum ("The Frankenstein Plan")

**Context:** A custom, parent-designed curriculum leveraging the father's background in biology/dentistry.
**Goal:** Create a rigorous, engaging, and hands-on Life Science course aligned with California NGSS standards.

## Core Resources

### Free Digital Curricula
*   **CK-12 Middle School Life Science FlexBook:** [Link](https://www.ck12.org/book/ck-12-life-science-for-middle-school/) - Customizable digital textbook with videos and simulations.
*   **OpenSciEd:** Inquiry-based units aligned with NGSS.
    *   *Unit 6.1:* Light & Matter
    *   *Unit 7.1:* Chemical Reactions & Matter (Photosynthesis/Respiration)
*   **Khan Academy:** Middle School Biology (NGSS) for supplementary videos and quizzes.

### Video Series ("The Spine")
*   **Crash Course Kids:** Intro topics (ecosystems, food webs).
*   **The Amoeba Sisters:** Cells, mitosis, meiosis, body systems (humorous and accurate).
*   **Bozeman Science:** For teacher prep and deep dives into NGSS concepts.

### Physical Textbooks (Used/Low Cost)
*   *Prentice Hall Science Explorer: Life Science*
*   *CPO Science: Focus on Life Science*
*   *Apologia: Exploring Creation with Life Science* (Christian worldview option)

## Curriculum Map: California 6th Grade Standards (NGSS)

### Unit 1: From Cells to Organisms
*   **Standard MS-LS1-1:** All living things are made of cells.
    *   *Activity:* Microscope lab (onion skin, cheek cells, pond water).
*   **Standard MS-LS1-2:** Cells -> Tissues -> Organs -> Systems.
    *   *Activity:* Build a model lung or diagram the digestive system.
*   **Standard MS-LS1-3:** Body as a system of interacting subsystems.
    *   *Project:* "Body Systems & Exercise" presentation.

### Unit 2: Ecosystems, Energy, and Dynamics
*   **Standards MS-LS1-6 & MS-LS2-3:** Photosynthesis and Respiration.
    *   *Activity:* Elodea plant experiment (oxygen bubbles).
*   **Standard MS-LS2-1:** Environmental effects on growth.
    *   *Activity:* Plant growth experiment (light/water variables).
*   **Standard MS-LS2-2:** Interactions in ecosystems (competition, predation, symbiosis).
    *   *Project:* Food web of Chino Hills State Park.

## Implementation Notes
*   **Role:** Father acts as primary instructor and lab director.
*   **Schedule:** Integrate labs weekly to maintain engagement.
*   **Assessment:** Use projects and presentations (e.g., the "Body Systems" project) rather than just tests.
