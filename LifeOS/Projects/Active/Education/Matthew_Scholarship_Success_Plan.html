    <!-- Created: July 22, 2025 at 8:27 PM -->
    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Neutrals -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application is structured as a chronological, single-page guide, moving from foundational strategy to an interactive timeline and actionable resources. This step-by-step flow (Foundations -> Search -> Applications -> Timeline -> Tools) is designed to walk a parent through the complex scholarship process in a logical, manageable sequence. It avoids overwhelming the user by presenting information in digestible phases. Key interactions include clickable cards for exploring scholarship types and a hover-able timeline chart to visualize the entire senior year at a glance. This task-oriented structure was chosen because the user's request is fundamentally a project to be managed, and this layout serves as a project plan. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        - Report Info: User needs a timeline for senior year. -> Goal: Show change/deadlines over time. -> Viz/Presentation: Interactive Horizontal Bar Chart (Gantt-style). -> Interaction: Hovering over bars reveals monthly tasks via tooltips. -> Justification: A visual Gantt chart is the most intuitive way to represent a year-long project with overlapping phases. It provides a clear, at-a-glance overview of what to do and when. -> Library/Method: Chart.js (Canvas).
        - Report Info: User needs to know where to find scholarships. -> Goal: Organize and inform. -> Viz/Presentation: Grid of styled, clickable cards. -> Interaction: Clicking a card reveals detailed information and tailored advice for that category. -> Justification: Cards are visually appealing and allow the user to self-select the information they want to explore, reducing initial cognitive load. -> Library/Method: HTML/CSS (Tailwind) + Vanilla JS for toggling content.
        - Report Info: User needs a way to track applications. -> Goal: Provide a practical tool. -> Viz/Presentation: A "Download CSV" button. -> Interaction: Clicking the button generates and downloads a pre-formatted spreadsheet template. -> Justification: A downloadable, editable file is far more practical for a user than a static table on a webpage. -> Library/Method: Vanilla JS to create and trigger a file download.

            <p class="max-w-3xl mx-auto text-lg text-slate-600">Welcome! This guide is tailored for high-achieving students like your son. Since your family income is high, our focus will be entirely on <strong class="font-semibold text-slate-800">merit-based scholarships</strong>. These are awarded for academic excellence, leadership, talent, and unique attributes—like his STEM focus and Naval Sea Cadet service—not financial need. Think of this not as asking for help, but as colleges competing for a top student.</p>

                <p class="max-w-2xl mx-auto mt-2 text-slate-600">Before the search begins, we need to get organized. This phase is about building a "brag sheet," understanding the landscape, and creating a system to manage the process. This preparation is the single most important step to maximizing success and minimizing stress.</p>

Include: GPA (weighted/unweighted), class rank, standardized test scores (if applicable), a comprehensive list of extracurriculars with dates and leadership roles, honors, awards, volunteer hours, and work experience.

Many universities, including prestigious private ones, <strong class="font-semibold">require the FAFSA to be on file</strong> before they will consider a student for any aid, including their own institutional merit scholarships. The CSS Profile is a more detailed form required by about 400, mostly private, colleges for the same reason. Check each college's financial aid website for their requirements.</p>
