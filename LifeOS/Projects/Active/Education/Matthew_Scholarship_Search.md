# Project: Matthew's Scholarship Search (Merit Aid Focus)

**Goal:** Secure merit-based funding for Matthew's college education, leveraging his STEM profile and Naval Sea Cadet service.
**Timeline:** Senior Year (2025-2026)
**Strategy:** High Income Strategy -> Focus 100% on Merit Aid (Institutional + Niche External).

## Key Resources
*   **Interactive Guide:** [Scholarship Success Plan with AI Features (Revised)](file:///home/austin/Documents/LifeOS/Projects/Education/Matthew_Scholarship_Success_Plan.html)
*   **Strategic Roadmap:** [Strategic Roadmap to College Affordability](file:///home/austin/Documents/LifeOS/Projects/Education/Strategic_Roadmap_College_Affordability.md)
*   **Tracker:** [Application Tracker (CSV)](file:///home/austin/Documents/LifeOS/Projects/Education/Scholarship_Applications_Tracker.csv)

## Current Status: Application Season (Winter)
*   **Submitted:** USC (Early Action - Merit Deadline Met?), Columbia (Early Decision/Action).
*   **In Progress:** University of California (UC) System.
*   **Date:** December 5, 2025.

## Strategic Analysis
*   **USC:** If applied by Nov 1, he is eligible for Trustee/Presidential (Full/Half Tuition). **High Priority:** Watch for interview invite in Jan/Feb.
*   **Columbia:** Ivy League schools do **not** offer merit scholarships, only need-based aid. As a high-income family, expect full tuition here unless external scholarships are won.
*   **UC Schools:** CA residents receive very little merit aid. The **Regents Scholarship** is the only major merit award (automatic consideration).
*   **Pivot:** Since institutional merit is locked in (USC) or unlikely (Columbia/UCs), the strategy must shift aggressively to **Tier 3 (External/Niche)** and **Tier 4 (Local)**.

## Action Items
*   [ ] **URGENT:** Check DoD SMART Scholarship Deadline (Roadmap says Dec 5 - TODAY!).
*   [ ] **High Priority:** Identify 5-10 "Niche" STEM/Military scholarships (Tier 3) to replace the lack of Ivy/UC merit aid.
*   [ ] **Spring:** Target Chino Valley / Local scholarships (Tier 4).
