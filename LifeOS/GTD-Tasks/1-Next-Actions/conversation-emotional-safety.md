# Conversation: Emotional Safety Baseline

**Goal**: Execute the "Emotional Safety" conversation with my wife to establish a baseline metric for our relationship growth.

## Preparation
- [ ] Review **[[Resources/Guides/Script_Emotional_Safety_Conversation|The Script & Roleplay Guide]]**
- [ ] Review **[[System/Personal-Transformation-Toolkit|Personal Transformation Toolkit]]** (specifically the "Neuropsychology of Resistance" to manage my own defensiveness)
- [ ] Choose the right time (low stress, private)

## Execution
- [ ] Ask the Question: "On a scale of 1-10, how emotionally safe do you feel...?"
- [ ] Ask the Follow-up: "What is ONE thing I can do to raise that by 1 point?"
- [ ] **LISTEN ONLY**. Do not defend. Use "Cognitive Defusion" if triggered.

## Post-Action
- [ ] Log the "Score" and the "Feedback" in today's Journal.
- [ ] Create a new habit/task based on her feedback.
