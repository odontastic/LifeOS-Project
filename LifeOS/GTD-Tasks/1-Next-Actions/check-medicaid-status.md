# Check Medi-Cal status and application method

## Action
Log in to [BenefitsCal.com](https://benefitscal.com/) OR call the county office to determine:
1.  Is the case "Suspended" (reinstatable) or "Closed" (needs reapplication)?
2.  Has it been more or less than 90 days since lapse?

## Why It Matters
Determines if you can just submit a form or need a full application.

## Next Steps
1.  Try logging into BenefitsCal.
2.  If login fails or status unclear, call county office.
3.  Update Project file with status.
