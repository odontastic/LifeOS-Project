# Return Taycan Lease

## Action
Return the Porsche Taycan to the dealership. Lease end.

## Critical Checklist
- [ ] **Keys**: Both sets of keys.
- [ ] **Manuals**: Owner's manual in glovebox.
- [ ] **Charger**: Charging cable/equipment included.
- [ ] **Personal Items**: **CHECK EVERYWHERE** (Sunglasses, garage opener, phone cables, papers in glovebox/visor).
- [ ] **Clean**: Quick wash/vacuum if required by lease (or just clear trash).

## Why It Matters
Smooth handover reduces wife's stress on her day off. Forgetting a garage opener or toll tag causes future headaches.

## Logistics
- **Date**: Friday, Nov 21
- **Driver**: Need 2 drivers or ride back? (Coordinate with wife).
