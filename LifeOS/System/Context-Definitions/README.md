# GTD Context Definitions

This directory contains definitions for all GTD contexts used in the LifeOS.

## Standard Contexts

- **@Computer** - Requires computer access (research, writing, coding)
- **@Home** - Can do anywhere at home (cleaning, organizing, thinking)
- **@Calls** - Phone calls to make
- **@Errands** - Outside the house (shopping, appointments)
- **@Shopping** - Specific purchases needed
- **@Cleaning** - Maintenance and cleaning tasks
- **@Organization** - Sorting, filing, system setup
- **@Kitchen** - Cooking and meal prep tasks

## How to Use Contexts

Contexts answer the question: **"What can I do RIGHT NOW given my current location, tools, and energy?"**

When processing tasks, always assign at least one context. This allows you to filter your Next Actions list by what's actually possible in your current situation.

## Adding New Contexts

If you find yourself repeatedly needing a new context (e.g., @Garage, @Office), create a new file in this directory following the template below.
