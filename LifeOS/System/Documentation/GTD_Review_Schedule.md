# GTD-Informed Schedule and Workflow Plan

## Overview
This plan provides a structured GTD-based routine for users managing active tasks in external applications while maintaining GTD principles for mindset and workflow reminders. The focus is on the critical review cycles that maintain system trust and clarity.

## Daily GTD Routine (15-30 minutes)
The daily routine focuses on maintaining awareness of your external task system and ensuring you're working from a clear perspective.

### Morning Check-In (5-10 minutes)
- **Review Calendar**: Scan upcoming appointments, deadlines, and time-specific commitments in your external app
- **Quick Context Scan**: Review available next actions by context (e.g., @Computer, @Calls, @Home) to identify what you can do immediately
- **Capture Any New Items**: Add any new thoughts or commitments to your external inbox

### Evening Wind-Down (10-15 minutes)
- **Review Completed Actions**: Note what was accomplished and any lessons learned
- **Prepare for Tomorrow**: Identify 1-3 priority next actions for the next day
- **Clear Mind**: Ensure all open loops are captured in your external system

## Weekly GTD Review (45-90 minutes)
The weekly review is the cornerstone of GTD - a dedicated time to maintain system integrity and course-correct your commitments.

### Setup (5 minutes)
- Schedule recurring time slot (e.g., Friday afternoon or Sunday evening)
- Prepare quiet space with access to external task application
- Gather any loose papers, notes, or digital captures

### Process All Inboxes (10-15 minutes)
- **Empty External Inbox**: Process any accumulated items in your external app's inbox
- **Review Physical/Digital Notes**: Add any captured items from notebooks, emails, or other sources
- **Clarify and Organize**: Ensure all items are properly categorized in your external system

### Review System Components (20-30 minutes)
- **Calendar Review**: Check past week and upcoming weeks for completeness
- **Next Actions Review**: Ensure actions are current, specific, and properly contextualized
- **Projects Review**: Verify project lists are complete and next actions support project goals
- **Waiting For Review**: Check delegated items and follow up as needed
- **Someday/Maybe Review**: Consider if any future items should become active

### Reflect and Plan (10-15 minutes)
- **Assess Progress**: What worked well? What needs adjustment?
- **Course Corrections**: Update priorities, delete obsolete items, add missing actions
- **Next Week Preview**: Identify key focus areas and prepare mentally

### Weekly Habits
- **Fixed Schedule**: Same day/time each week for consistency
- **No Interruptions**: Treat as sacred time
- **Complete Closure**: End with confidence that system is current and trustworthy

## Higher Horizons Review (Monthly/Quarterly/Annually)
These longer-cycle reviews ensure alignment with higher-level goals and life priorities.

### Monthly Review (30-60 minutes)
- **Areas of Focus Assessment**: Review ongoing responsibilities and standards maintenance
- **Project Progress Check**: Assess advancement toward goals across all active projects
- **Resource Review**: Update reference materials and ensure they're accessible
- **System Health Check**: Evaluate if current tools and processes serve your needs

### Quarterly Review (60-90 minutes)
- **Purpose Alignment**: Reconnect with 3-5 year vision and ensure current activities support it
- **Major Project Planning**: Plan initiatives for the next quarter
- **Life Balance Check**: Assess time allocation across key life areas
- **Process Optimization**: Identify workflow improvements or tool changes

### Annual Review (90-120 minutes)
- **Year in Review**: Document achievements, lessons learned, and growth
- **Vision Refresh**: Update long-term goals and purpose statements
- **Strategic Planning**: Set annual themes and major initiatives
- **System Evolution**: Consider major changes to tools, processes, or life structure

## Implementation Guidelines

### Mindset Maintenance
- **Trust Building**: Regular reviews build confidence in your external system
- **Mind Like Water**: Use reviews to achieve calm, clear responsiveness
- **External Focus**: Reviews remind you of GTD principles without managing tasks directly

### Time Blocking Recommendations
- **Daily**: 15-30 minutes total (morning + evening)
- **Weekly**: 45-90 minutes (protected time block)
- **Monthly**: 30-60 minutes (end of month)
- **Quarterly**: 60-90 minutes (quarter-end)
- **Annual**: 90-120 minutes (year-end)

### Success Metrics
- **System Trust**: Do you confidently know what to do next?
- **Mental Clarity**: Reduced anxiety about forgotten commitments
- **Consistent Review**: Weekly reviews completed without fail
- **Purpose Alignment**: Higher horizons reviews maintain life direction

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- **Skipping Weekly Reviews**: This breaks the system - protect this time
- **Over-managing Daily**: Keep daily routines light to avoid burnout
- **Neglecting Higher Horizons**: Long-term drift occurs without periodic alignment
- **Tool Switching**: Focus on process, not perfect tools
