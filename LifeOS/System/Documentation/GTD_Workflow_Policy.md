# GTD Workflow Policy

## Purpose

This document establishes the official policy regarding Getting Things Done (GTD) methodology within the LifeOS system and defines the current approach to task management.

## Current Policy: GTD for Reference Only

The Getting Things Done (GTD) methodology has been transitioned from an active workflow system to a reference framework within LifeOS. GTD is no longer used as the primary task management system for active to-do tracking.

## GTD Reference Materials Location

Complete GTD methodology documentation remains available in the `03-Resources/` directory for reference and learning purposes, including:

- `getting_things_done_methodology.md` - Complete GTD methodology overview
- `PARA_GTD_Integration.md` - GTD and PARA system integration guide
- Related templates and supporting materials

## Active Task Management Policy

All active task management and to-do tracking is now handled by an external productivity application. This change was implemented to:

- Separate active workflow from reference materials
- Allow for more flexible task management tools
- Reduce complexity within the LifeOS structure
- Enable better integration with external productivity ecosystems

## PARA Structure and GTD Principles

While GTD is no longer the active workflow, the LifeOS organizational structure (PARA method) continues to align with core GTD principles:

- **Projects** - Aligns with GTD Projects (outcomes requiring multiple actions)
- **Areas** - Corresponds to GTD Areas of Responsibility (ongoing standards)
- **Resources** - Supports GTD Reference materials and support information
- **Archives** - Maintains GTD Someday/Maybe and completed work

This structural alignment ensures that GTD concepts remain accessible and can be referenced when needed, while active task management operates through the chosen external application.

## Implementation Date

This policy was implemented on 2025-11-15, transitioning GTD from an active workflow to a reference framework within LifeOS.
