1. **De-escalate**:
   - Say: "I'm here. Take a deep breath. Let's slow down."
   - Ask: "On a scale of 1-10, how high is the emotional intensity right now?"
   - If > 7, say: "High intensity means low logic. Do not try to solve the problem right now. Focus on safety and calm."

2. **Consult Wisdom**:
   - Read `Resources/Guides/Wife-Translator.md` (if available) or `System/CONTEXT.md` to recall the "Pursue-Withdraw" pattern.
   - Remind user: "Remember: Her criticism is likely a fear response. She is not attacking you; she is protesting disconnection."

3. **Action Plan**:
   - Ask: "What is the most loving, non-defensive thing you can do in the next 5 minutes?"
   - Suggest: "Soft eye contact. A gentle touch. Saying 'I can see you're hurting and I want to understand.'"

4. **Log Incident**:
   - Create a private entry in `Areas/Personal-Reflection/Journal/` titled "Crisis Log - [Time]".
   - Record: Trigger, Reaction, and Repair Plan.
