description: Run the morning coaching session to set the day's focus
---

1. **Open Context**: Read `System/CONTEXT.md` to ground yourself in the user's values.
2. **Open Journal**:
   - Determine today's date (YYYY-MM-DD).
   - Open or create `Areas/Personal-Reflection/Journal/[YYYY-MM-DD].md` using the Daily Template.
   - If creating, use `System/Templates/daily-journal-template.md` (if it exists) or a standard header.
3. **Coaching Dialogue**:
   - Ask the user: "Good morning. Let's calibrate. How are you feeling emotionally right now?"
   - Wait for response.
   - Ask: "What is the ONE THING that matters most today?"
   - Wait for response.
4. **Update Dashboard**:
   - Update `/home/austin/Documents/LifeOS/Dashboard.md`.
   - Set the "Date" to today.
   - Update the "Daily Focus" section with the user's "ONE THING" and "Emotion Check".
5. **Wrap Up**:
   - Say: "Dashboard updated. Have a virtuous day."
