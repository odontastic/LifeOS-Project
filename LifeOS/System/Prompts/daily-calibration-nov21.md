# ☀️ Daily Priority Calibration
**Time**: Friday, Nov 21 (Projected)

*Compassionate Firmness Protocol Active*

**Context**: Wife is OFF. Taycan Return + Trip Prep. High Stress Potential.

### 1. The ONE THING
**Execute the Taycan Return & Packing FLAWLESSLY.**
- No forgotten items in the car.
- No last-minute packing panic.

### 2. The "Minor" Test (Critical Today)
- **Taycan**: Check the glovebox/visor/trunk 3 times. If you leave the garage opener, it signals "inattention."
- **Packing**: Do not ask "where is my..." Find it yourself.

### 3. Virtue Focus: Solicitude
- Anticipate her stress. "I've already checked the tire pressure/cleaned the trash out."
- "I have the passports ready."

### 4. Health/Medicaid Note
- **Pause**: We likely cannot call Medicaid tomorrow if we are running errands/packing.
- **Plan**: Move Medicaid call to **Monday, Dec 1** (or first business day after trip? Or do it from airport?).
- *Correction*: If trip is long, 90-day window might close. **Can you spare 30 mins tomorrow morning before the car return?**

### 5. Evening Reflection
- Did we leave for the trip with peace or panic?
