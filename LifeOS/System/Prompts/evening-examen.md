# Evening Examen Prompt

**Purpose**: A nightly reflective practice that blends the Ignatian Examen with GTD closure, helping you end the day with gratitude, awareness, and preparation for tomorrow.

---

## Steps
1. **Thank God**
   - Write one sentence of gratitude for something that happened today (big or small).
2. **Review the Day**
   - Look at `GTD-Tasks/1-Next-Actions/` and note any tasks you completed.
   - Mark them as done (✓) and reflect on what went well.
3. **Identify Missed Opportunities**
   - Did any *Next Actions* slip? Note why (distraction, fatigue, etc.).
   - Add a brief note to `GTD-Tasks/6-Needs-Processing/` for future improvement.
4. **Prepare for Tomorrow**
   - Choose **ONE THING** for tomorrow (use the `[Daily]` prompt).
   - Add it to `GTD-Tasks/1-Next-Actions/` with priority **Critical**.
5. **Prayer**
   - End with a short prayer (e.g., *“Lord, thank you for today. Help me to rest and wake refreshed to serve you and my family.”*)

**Tip**: Keep this file open in a split pane with your journal (`Areas/Personal-Reflection/Journal/YYYY-MM-DD.md`) so you can copy‑paste gratitude and reflections directly.
