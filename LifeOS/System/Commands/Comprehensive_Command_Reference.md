# Comprehensive Second Brain Command Reference

This document contains all commands, prefixes, and phrases you can use to interact with your Second Brain through AI chat. It combines the core commands and all commands for the specialized folders.

## Natural Language Understanding

While this guide provides specific command formats, your AI assistant is designed to understand natural language requests even when you don't use the exact command format. The system will:

1. Analyze your message content and intent
2. Map it to the most appropriate command
3. Execute the relevant action
4. Confirm what was done

For example, saying "I had a thought about combining AI with blockchain" will be interpreted as a `[Thought]` command, even without the brackets.

See `Commands/Natural_Language_Understanding.md` for a comprehensive guide on how natural language requests are processed.

## Natural Language Understanding

Your AI assistant will recognize natural language cues to categorize content into the appropriate folders, even without explicit commands. For example:

- "I've been getting into chess lately..." → Interests/Hobbies/chess.md
- "Last night I dreamt about..." → Personal/Dreams/[date]_dream.md
- "Made an amazing pasta dish tonight..." → Lifestyle/Food/pasta_recipes.md
- "Just watched Inception and noticed..." → Media/Movies/inception.md
- "Planning my next career move toward..." → Professional/Career/career_planning.md
- "What if we created an app that..." → Creativity/Ideas/app_concepts.md
- "I love this line from Marcus Aurelius..." → Collections/Quotes/stoicism_quotes.md
- "The Stoic practice of negative visualization..." → Niche Topics/Philosophy/stoicism.md

See `Commands/Natural_Language_Understanding.md` for a comprehensive guide on natural language processing.

## Tips for Effective Commands

1. **Be specific** about exactly what you want
2. **Start with the appropriate prefix** for new content
3. **Include location information** when needed
4. **Mention related notes** to create connections
5. **Use multiple commands** for complex operations (I'll execute them in sequence)
6. **Ask for confirmation** if you're unsure about a major reorganization
7. **Provide feedback** about what works well and what doesn't

Remember that you can always use natural language to explain what you want. If a specific command doesn't exist for your needs, simply describe what you're looking for, and I'll help implement it.
