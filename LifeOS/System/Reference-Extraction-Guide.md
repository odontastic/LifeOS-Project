# Quick Reference: How to Process Note References

Use when processing notes that mention books, experts, media, etc.

## Quick Checklist

When you (or I) process a new note, scan for:

- [ ] **Books** mentioned by title or author
- [ ] **Movies, Documentaries, Shows** by title or creator
- [ ] **Researchers, Experts, Speakers** and their work
- [ ] **Articles, Papers, Essays** by title or author
- [ ] **Podcasts or Courses** by name or instructor

## The Five-Second Decision

For each reference, ask:
1. **Is it actionable?** (Can you read/watch it?)
2. **Is it aligned?** (Does it support your goals?)
3. **Is it new?** (Not already in your lists?)

✓ If YES to all three → Add it to the appropriate list
✗ If NO to any → Skip it (but you can still link it if contextually important)

## Where It Goes

| **Type** | **Destination** | **Task Folder** |
|----------|----------------|-----------------|
| Books, Articles, Papers | `Resources/Lists/to_read_list.md` | `GTD-Tasks/4-To-Read/` |
| Movies, Docs, Shows, Videos | `Resources/Lists/to_watch_list.md` | `GTD-Tasks/4-To-Watch/` (create if needed) |
| Experts/People (no specific content) | `Resources/People/[name].md` | N/A |

## Entry Template

Use this template when adding to To Read/Watch lists:

```markdown
### [Title]
**Source:** [Author/Creator]
**Category:** [Topic 1, Topic 2]
**Added:** [YYYY-MM-DD]
**Priority:** [Critical/High/Medium]
**Status:** Not Started

**Why:** [How this supports your goals or why it's important]

**Key Topics:**
- [Topic 1]
- [Topic 2]

**Action After Reading/Watching:**
- [Specific next step]

**Referenced In:**
- [[Note/Path|Note Name]] - [Context]
```

## Full Workflow

For the complete step-by-step process, see:
- [[.agent/workflows/process_note_references|Process Note References Workflow]]

## Integration

This process works with:
- **Daily note capture** - Process references as you create notes
- **Morning calibration** - Part of reviewing yesterday's notes
- **Weekly review** - Batch process all accumulated notes

**Remember**: The goal is to capture valuable resources *and* maintain context through bidirectional links. Don't just add items—connect them to your life and goals.
