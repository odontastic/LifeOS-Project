# Using Templates in Your Second Brain

Templates are essential tools for maintaining consistency in your Second Brain. This guide explains how to use each template effectively.

## Available Templates

Your Second Brain comes with these ready-to-use templates:

1. **General Note Template**: `Resources/Templates/note_template.md`
2. **Daily Journal Template**: `Resources/Templates/daily_journal_template.md`
3. **Learning Template**: `Resources/Templates/learning_template.txt`
4. **Creating Template**: `Resources/Templates/creating_template.txt`

## When to Use Each Template

### General Note Template

**Use for**: General ideas, concepts, facts, and information that doesn't fit into the more specialized categories.

**Best practices**:
- Fill in all metadata fields for better AI understanding
- Be consistent with your tagging system
- Link to related notes with the `[[note-name]]` format
- Break content into logical sections with headings

**Example use case**: Capturing a new idea that occurred to you, summarizing a concept, or documenting a procedure.

### Daily Journal Template

**Use for**: Daily reflections, tracking mood, energy, focus, and capturing the day's events and learnings.

**Best practices**:
- Create a new entry each day named `YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- Be consistent with your ratings (1-10 scale)
- Link to other notes when you mention concepts or ideas
- Review previous entries periodically for patterns

**Example use case**: Morning planning and reflection, evening review, tracking daily insights and progress.

### Learning Template

**Use for**: Structured capture of learning experiences from books, courses, articles, videos, or personal experiences.

**Best practices**:
- Be specific about the source of learning
- Focus on concrete examples and applications
- Note questions that arise during learning
- Create clear action items for applying knowledge

**Example use case**: Summarizing key points from a book chapter, documenting insights from an online course, or capturing what you learned from a conference talk.

### Creating Template

**Use for**: Tracking creative projects, their progress, process, and outcomes.

**Best practices**:
- Update the status field as your project progresses
- Document challenges and solutions
- Record feedback received and changes made
- Note lessons learned for future projects

**Example use case**: Documenting a writing project, tracking a design process, or managing code development.

## Step-by-Step Process for Using Templates

### 1. Select the Right Template

Ask yourself:
- What kind of information am I capturing?
- What is the purpose of this note?
- How will I want to retrieve this information later?

### 2. Create a New File in the Right Location

- **For general notes**: Choose between `Knowledge/Concepts/`, `Knowledge/Facts/`, or `Knowledge/Procedures/`
- **For journal entries**: Use `Journal/Daily/`, `Journal/Weekly/`, or `Journal/Monthly/`
- **For learning notes**: Use `Resources/` or `Knowledge/` depending on whether it's reference material or processed knowledge
- **For creation notes**: Use `Projects/Active/` or create a specific project subfolder

### 3. Copy and Paste the Template

1. Open the template file
2. Select all content (Ctrl+A or Cmd+A)
3. Copy (Ctrl+C or Cmd+C)
4. Navigate to your new file
5. Paste (Ctrl+V or Cmd+V)

### 4. Fill in the Template

1. Start with the metadata section
2. Replace placeholder text with your content
3. Remove sections that aren't relevant (optional)
4. Add additional sections if needed (optional)

### 5. Create Connections

1. Add appropriate tags in the metadata section
2. Link to related notes using the `[[note-name]]` format
3. Create a new tag file in the `Tags/` directory if using a new tag

### 6. Review and Update

- Periodically review and update your notes
- Move projects to `Projects/Completed/` when finished
- Archive old or no longer relevant notes to `Archive/`

## Customizing Templates

Feel free to customize these templates to better suit your needs:

1. Make a copy of an existing template
2. Modify fields or sections as needed
3. Save with a new name in the `Resources/Templates/` directory

## AI-Friendly Template Use

For optimal AI interaction:

1. **Be consistent**: Use the same format for dates, tags, and metadata
2. **Be explicit**: Avoid ambiguity in your notes
3. **Use descriptive titles**: Make it clear what each note contains
4. **Maintain connections**: Keep cross-references and tags up to date

By consistently using templates, your Second Brain will become more organized, accessible, and valuable over time—both for you and for AI assistants working with your knowledge.
