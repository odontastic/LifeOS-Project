# Script: The Emotional Safety Conversation

**Goal**: Establish a baseline for emotional safety in the marriage and identify one concrete action to improve it.
**Virtue Focus**: Humility (Asking for feedback) & Charity (Listening without defense).

## The Setup
*   **Timing**: Choose a low-stress moment (e.g., after dinner, during a walk). Avoid doing this right after a conflict.
*   **Environment**: Private, no distractions (phones away).
*   **Mindset**: You are a researcher gathering data, not a defendant on trial. Your goal is *understanding*, not *agreement*.

## The Script

### 1. The Opening (Vulnerability)
"Hey, I've been doing some thinking about us and my own growth. I realize I often stay in my head and miss what's happening in your heart. I want to change that."

### 2. The Question (The Metric)
"I want to ask you something, and I promise I'm just listening, not trying to defend myself.

**On a scale of 1 to 10, how 'emotionally safe' do you feel sharing your deepest worries or feelings with me right now?**"

*(Wait. Do not interrupt. Accept the number.)*

### 3. The Follow-Up (The Action)
"Thank you for being honest. I really appreciate that.

**What is ONE specific thing I could do—or stop doing—that would raise that number by just 1 point?**"

### 4. The Closing (Gratitude)
"I hear you. [Repeat back what she said to confirm understanding]. I'm going to work on that. Thank you for helping me."

## Roleplay / Anticipating Responses

### Scenario A: She gives a low number (1-4)
*   **Her Reaction**: "Honestly? Like a 3. You always try to fix it or tell me I'm being irrational."
*   **Your Instinct (The Trap)**: "I don't say you're irrational, I just want to solve the problem!" (Defense).
*   **Your Response ( The Win)**: "A 3. Okay. That's hard to hear, but I needed to know. So, if I stopped trying to 'fix' it and just listened, that would help?"

### Scenario B: She is suspicious ("Why are you asking this?")
*   **Her Reaction**: "Where is this coming from? Did something happen?"
*   **Your Response**: "No, nothing happened. I've just been realizing that I've been too focused on logic and tasks, and I've neglected the emotional side of our marriage. I want to be better at this."

### Scenario C: She deflects ("I don't know, everything is fine.")
*   **Her Reaction**: "Oh, we're fine, don't worry about it."
*   **Your Response**: "I know we're 'fine' functionally, but I want us to be great emotionally. Even if it's an 8, what would make it a 9? I really want to know."

## Post-Conversation Review
*   [ ] Record the "Baseline Number" in your Journal.
*   [ ] Create a new Task for the "One Thing" she requested.
