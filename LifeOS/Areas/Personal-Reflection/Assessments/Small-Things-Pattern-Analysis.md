# The "Small Things" Pattern - Specific Examples

## Documented Incidents

### 1. Cabinet Doors
**What Happens:**
- I sometimes forget or delay closing a cabinet door
- I would close it eventually
- She gets upset when she notices

**Analysis:**
- **My perspective**: "I'll get to it" (task is in queue, not forgotten)
- **Her perspective**: Open cabinet = incomplete task = chaos/risk
- **The disconnect**: To her, "eventually" = "never" because she can't see my internal queue

### 2. Shower Hand Sprayer
**What Happens:**
- Sometimes forget to deactivate hand sprayer after use
- She only notices the times I forget
- She doesn't notice (or acknowledge) when I remember

**Analysis:**
- **My perspective**: "I remember most of the time, why focus on the failures?"
- **Her perspective**: The ONE time I forget = proof I don't care about her needs
- **The disconnect**: **Negativity bias** - failures are more salient than successes

### 3. Kitchen Organization (from initial assessment)
**What Happens:**
- Don't organize/stack dirty dishes while cooking
- She wants "clean as you go" with visual order
- I focus on task (cooking), not aesthetics (appearance)

**Analysis:**
- **My perspective**: "I'm cooking dinner, isn't that enough?"
- **Her perspective**: Visual chaos = loss of control = anxiety spike
- **The disconnect**: I don't see the mess; she can't NOT see it

## The Core Pattern: Attention vs. Intention

### What I'm Learning:

**It's not about the cabinet door or the shower sprayer.**

It's about: **"Does he notice the details that matter to me?"**

### The Negativity Bias Problem

**Psychological Principle**: Humans (especially anxious people) notice **threats** more than **safety**.

- When I DO remember → No threat → Invisible to her brain
- When I DON'T remember → Threat detected → Alarm bells

**Result**: She has a **skewed dataset**. Her brain collects evidence of my failures, not my successes.

**This is NOT her fault.** This is how anxiety works.

### The "Eventually" Problem

**My ADHD/INTP Brain**: 
- Task goes into mental queue
- "I'll close the cabinet when I walk by again"
- This feels like "handled"

**Her Risk-Averse Brain**:
- Open cabinet = incomplete task
- Incomplete task = unreliable system
- Unreliable system = danger

**The Translation**: When I say "eventually," she hears "never, unless I remind you."

## Why This Matters (The Deeper Issue)

### It's Not About Cabinets

**What she's really asking:**
- "Can I trust you to notice details?"
- "Will you see problems before they become crises?"
- "Am I alone in maintaining order?"

**What my pattern blindness signals to her:**
- "He doesn't notice what I notice"
- "I have to be the one who catches everything"
- "I can't relax because he won't catch what I miss"

### The Mental Load Asymmetry

**Her burden**:
- Notice everything (cabinets, shower, kitchen, etc.)
- Remember everything
- Carry anxiety about everything
- Manage entire family's safety/security

**My burden**:
- Do tasks when asked
- Try to remember
- Feel shame when I forget

**The asymmetry**: She carries the **noticing** burden. I only carry the **doing** burden.

**And noticing is EXHAUSTING.**

---

## The Intervention Strategy

### 1. Acknowledge the Asymmetry

**What I need to say to her:**
> "I'm realizing that you carry the burden of noticing all these details, and I don't. That's not fair. You have to be vigilant about cabinets, showers, kitchens, and a thousand other things, while I get to just... not notice. I want to help carry that load."

### 2. Build "Noticing" Systems

**The problem**: My brain doesn't naturally scan for these details.

**The solution**: Create **external triggers** that force me to notice.

**Examples:**
- **Cabinet doors**: Before leaving kitchen, scan counters left-to-right for open cabinets
- **Shower**: Last action before exiting = check sprayer position
- **Kitchen**: Set timer for "shutdown protocol" after cooking

### 3. Make Successes Visible

**The problem**: She only notices failures (negativity bias).

**The solution**: **Announce successes** to train her brain to see them.

**Examples:**
- "I just closed all the cabinets" (casual mention)
- "Shower sprayer is deactivated" (as I leave bathroom)
- "Kitchen is clean" (before sitting down)

**Why this works**: 
- Gives her brain positive data points
- Reduces her vigilance (she doesn't have to check)
- Shows I'm THINKING about her needs

### 4. Accept That "Eventually" Isn't Good Enough

**Hard truth**: For someone carrying mental load, "eventually" = "I have to remember to remind you."

**New standard**: 
- Close the cabinet NOW, not "when I walk by again"
- Deactivate the sprayer NOW, not "next time I shower"
- Clean the kitchen NOW, not "after I rest"

**Why**: Because "eventually" transfers the burden back to her (she has to notice it's still not done).

---

## The Compassion Piece (For Me)

### I'm Not Broken

**INTP + possible ADHD-inattentive** = naturally low detail-noticing.

This is a **cognitive difference**, not a character flaw.

**BUT**: Cognitive differences still have real impacts on others.

### The Growth Edge

**I can't change my brain's natural scanning patterns.**

**I CAN**:
- Build compensatory systems
- Create external triggers
- Practice deliberate noticing
- Acknowledge the burden she carries

## Action Items

### Immediate (This Week):

1. **Cabinet Protocol**: Before leaving any room, scan for open cabinets/drawers
2. **Shower Protocol**: Last action = check sprayer, check curtain, check floor
3. **Kitchen Protocol**: "Shutdown checklist" before sitting down

### Short-term (This Month):

4. **Visibility Practice**: Announce when I complete these tasks (make successes visible)
5. **Acknowledgment**: Tell her I see the burden she carries
6. **Pattern Tracking**: Log in daily journal when I remember vs. forget

### Medium-term (3 Months):

7. **Habit Formation**: Make these protocols automatic (no conscious effort)
8. **Expand Noticing**: What other details does she notice that I don't?
9. **Reduce Her Vigilance**: Goal = she can relax because she trusts I'll catch things

## The Wife Translator Application

**When she says**: "You left the cabinet open AGAIN!"

**She means**: 
- "I'm exhausted from being the only one who notices these things"
- "I can't trust you to maintain order without me"
- "I'm scared that if I don't catch everything, our life will fall apart"

**My new response** (instead of shame/withdrawal):
> "You're right. I didn't notice. I know you're carrying the burden of noticing all these details, and I want to help. I'm going to close it now and work on catching it myself next time."

## Reflection Question

**For me to think about:**

> "What would it feel like to carry the burden of noticing EVERYTHING? To know that if I don't catch the open cabinet, the forgotten sprayer, the messy kitchen, no one else will? How would that feel after 20+ years of marriage?"

**Answer**: Exhausting. Lonely. Scary.

**And that's what she lives with every day.**

No wonder she gets upset about cabinets.
