# Assessment Update - 2025-11-20

**Time**: 21:03
**Context**: Post-Crisis Integration

## 1. Emotional Capacity
**Score**: 3-4/10 (Manageable)
**Status**: "I feel alright and will deal with it."
**Analysis**: This is a resilient baseline. You are not shutting down. You are ready to work.

## 2. Guilt Assessment
**Belief**: "I think I can make up for it and I will try harder and do more and not give up."
**Shift**: Moving from **Passive Guilt** (freezing) to **Active Redemption** (trying harder).
**Coach Note**: This is the critical pivot. Action cures guilt.

## 3. Wife Assessment
**Insight**: "She would feel much better and feel more at ease if my health were insured and I got a check-up, vaccinations, colonoscopy, prostate exam, and other diagnostics."
**Validation**: You correctly identified that her anxiety is specific and actionable. It's not just "be better"; it's "get checked."

## 4. System Awareness
**Date/Time**: Yes, I am aware it is **Thursday, November 20, 2025, at 9:03 PM**.
**Capabilities**:
- **Weekly Reviews**: I have updated the checklist to include Medicaid/Health checks.
- **Daily Check-ins**: I can run these on command.
- **Reminders**: I cannot "ping" you autonomously (I don't run in the background), but when we interact, I will ALWAYS check the time and your deadlines.

## Next Steps
- **Immediate**: Sleep. It's 9pm.
- **Tomorrow (Friday)**: Execute the Medicaid status check first thing.
