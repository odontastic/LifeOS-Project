# Initial Coaching Assessment

**Date**: 2025-11-20

## 1. The "Small Thing" Conflict
**Question**: What is the single most common "small thing" you forget that has led to a conflict in the past 48 hours?
**Answer**: My wife got mad at me for not cleaning up the kitchen as I am cooking, like she does. Not organizing and stacking the dirty utensils, dishes, and plates in the sink (note: we are not talking about pre-washing, scrubbing, or cleaning, just making it look neat!)

**Analysis (LifeOS)**:
- **Risk Signal**: To a detail-oriented, risk-averse person (Wife), a chaotic sink signals *loss of control* and *disrespect for the shared environment*. It says "I don't see the work you do to keep order."
- **Pattern**: "Clean as you go" is a process pattern. The conflict isn't about the dishes; it's about the *visual chaos* triggering her anxiety about order/stability.
- **Virtue Opportunity**: **Orderliness** (a sub-virtue of Temperance) and **Service**.

## 2. Emotional Attunement Baseline
**Question**: On a scale of 1 to 10, how confident are you in your ability to recognize and name your wife's underlying feeling when she is becoming anxious?
**Answer**: Maybe low medium, 3 or 4? I'm not sure, but I think I'm a little better.

**Analysis (LifeOS)**:
- **Baseline**: 3.5/10. This is the primary growth area.
- **Gap**: Uncertainty ("I'm not sure") indicates a lack of feedback loops. You don't know if you're right because you might not be checking.
- **Action**: We need to implement "Perception Checking" (e.g., "I'm sensing you're feeling X, is that right?").

## 3. Target Virtue
**Question**: What is one virtue, central to your Catholic faith, you feel you most need to focus on to improve your marriage health?
**Answer**: I don't know if i can name one virtue that would be so helpful to improve my marriage health. Maybe talk to her more? spend more time with her? Just do more of what she wants in a timely manner.

**Analysis (LifeOS)**:
- **Identified Need**: "Do more of what she wants in a timely manner" = **Obedience** (listening/heeding) and **Diligence**.
- **Identified Need**: "Talk to her more/spend time" = **Charity** (Love as action) and **Presence**.
- **Theological Connection**: St. Joseph is the model here—the "Just Man" who acts promptly to protect the family (flight to Egypt) and provides silent, steady presence.
- **Focus Virtue**: Let's call it **Solicitude** (an aspect of Charity)—active, anxious care for the other's well-being.

## 🚀 Initial Action Plan

1.  **Kitchen Protocol**: Implement "Mise en place" (everything in its place). The goal is visual order *during* the process, not just after.
2.  **Emotional Training**: Daily "Emotion Spotting". When you see her, ask yourself: "What is she feeling right now?" and write it down.
3.  **Virtue Practice**: **Promptness**. When she asks for something, do it *immediately* (or schedule it immediately and tell her when).
