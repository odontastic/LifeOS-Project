# Module 2: The Science of Attunement

## The Analytical Challenge
The analytical mind ("System Builder") naturally defaults to **Problem Solving**.
- **Trigger**: Wife expresses negative emotion.
- **Default Response**: "Here is the solution to X."
- **Result**: Wife feels unheard; "Pursue-Withdraw" cycle activates.

## The Solution: ATTUNE
Dr. John Gottman's framework for building trust is an algorithm. It must be executed **in order**.

### 1. A - Attention
* **The Check**: Is my input channel open?
* **Action**: Put down the phone. Pause the video. Turn the chair.
* **Motto**: "Eyes on the prize."

### 2. T - Turn Toward
* **The Check**: Is my orientation welcoming?
* **Action**: Physical orientation implies psychological availability.
* **Motto**: "Face the data source."

### 3. T - Tolerance
* **The Check**: Am I filtering for "correctness"?
* **Action**: Accept that her *experience* is valid, even if her *facts* seem wrong to you.
* **Motto**: "Logic is secondary to connection."

### 4. U - Understand
* **The Check**: Do I know the *why*?
* **Action**: Ask questions. "Tell me more about that." "What is the worst part of this for you?"
* **Motto**: "Gather requirements before coding."

### 5. N - Non-defensive
* **The Check**: is my firewall up?
* **Action**: Drop the defense. Even if she is critical, find the kernel of truth.
* **Motto**: "Accept the bug report."

### 6. E - Empathy
* **The Check**: Can I name the feeling?
* **Action**: "That sounds incredibly frustrating." "I can see why you'd be hurt by that."
* **Motto**: "Validate the state."

## 🛠️ The Protocol
When in doubt, **DO NOT FIX**.
Ask: *"Do you want a solution, or do you want to be heard?"*
90% of the time, the answer is "Heard."
