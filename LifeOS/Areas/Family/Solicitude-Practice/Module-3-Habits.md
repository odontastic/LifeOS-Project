# Module 3: The Algorithms of Care

## The "Tiny Habits" Method
We cannot rely on willpower. We must rely on **Cognitive Anchors**.
Formula: `IF [Anchor] THEN [Micro-Habit]`

## 📜 The Codebase

### Routine 1: The Morning Boot
* **Anchor**: Pouring the first cup of coffee.
* **Micro-Habit**: Ask, *"What is the one thing stressing her out today?"*
* **Action**: Send a text or prep a solution for that specific stressor.

### Routine 2: The Threshold Protocol
* **Anchor**: Walking through the front door (or leaving the home office).
* **Micro-Habit**: Pause for 10 seconds. Assess the "Emotional Weather."
* **Action**: Adjust energy level to match or support hers. Do not dump *your* day until you have downloaded *hers*.

### Routine 3: The Debugger
* **Anchor**: She mentions a problem/complaint.
* **Micro-Habit**: The "Fork in the Road" question.
* **Action**: Ask, *"Do you want me to help solve this, or do you just need me to listen?"*

### Routine 4: The Grace Injection
* **Anchor**: Saying Grace at dinner.
* **Micro-Habit**: Insert a specific intention.
* **Action**: Pray for her specific burden aloud. "Lord, please help [Name] with [Project X] tomorrow."

## 📉 The 20:1 Ratio
Research shows happy couples have 20 positive interactions for every 1 negative/neutral one.
* **Low Cost, High Frequency**:
    * A touch on the shoulder.
    * A text at 2 PM.
    * Filling her water bottle.
    * Clearing her plate.
* **The Game**: Gamify this. Can you hit 20 before bed?
