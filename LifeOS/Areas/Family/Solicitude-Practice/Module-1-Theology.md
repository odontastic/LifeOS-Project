# Module 1: The Theology of Attention

## 1. St. Thomas Aquinas on Solicitude
Aquinas defines **Solicitude** (*solicitudo*) not as worry, but as a virtue related to **Prudence**.
- It is an "alertness of mind."
- It is the opposite of negligence (*negligentia*).
- It is the "anxious care" to ensure that what needs to be done for the good of another is actually done.

**The System Builder's Take**:
Solicitude is the **Watchdog Process** of the soul. It is a background daemon that constantly scans the environment for the needs of the beloved. It is not passive; it is actively polling for status updates.

## 2. St. John Paul II on Original Solitude
In the *Theology of the Body*, JPII teaches that man's first experience was "Original Solitude."
- This was not loneliness (a defect).
- It was the realization of **Subjectivity**: "I am a person, distinct from the animals."
- This solitude was the *necessary prerequisite* for the **Gift of Self**. You cannot give what you do not possess.

**The Reframe for the Introvert**:
Your "loner" nature—your comfort with deep, internal processing—is a **feature, not a bug**.
- You possess a high degree of "Original Solitude."
- The challenge is not to destroy this solitude, but to **pivot** it.
- Instead of processing *abstract systems*, process the *mystery of your wife*.

## 🧠 Integration Exercise
**The Pivot**:
When you catch yourself deep in thought (System 2 thinking), ask:
> "How can I apply this same intensity of focus to [Wife's Name]'s current emotional state?"
