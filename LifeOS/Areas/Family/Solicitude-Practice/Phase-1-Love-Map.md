# 🗺️ Phase 1: Building the Love Map

**Objective**: Gather data on her inner world to inform Phase II habits.

## 🗣️ The 10 Questions
*Ask these over the course of a few low-key evenings.*

### I. The Emotional Landscape (The "Now")
1.  "What is the single biggest stressor or worry you're holding onto right now that you haven't brought up?"
2.  "Who at work/in the family is currently your biggest source of energy and who is your biggest drain right now?"
3.  "If you had 30 minutes entirely to yourself today, what would you do? (And why that specific thing?)"
4.  "How does your body typically signal to you that you've hit your limit for the day? (E.g., headache, silence, need to clean.)"

### II. The Needs & Preferences (The "How to Serve")
5.  "When you feel overwhelmed, what is the *one* thing I can say or do that provides you the most immediate relief?" (**Critical Data Point**)
6.  "When I show you affection, do you prefer that it's physical, verbal, or focused on a chore/task?"
7.  "What is one small thing I used to do, that I've stopped doing, that you really miss?"

### III. The Future & Identity (The "Long-Term Vision")
8.  "What's one thing you'd love to learn or accomplish for yourself in the next year, just for the joy of it?"
9.  "What is one thing that I do or say that immediately helps you feel more optimistic about our family's long-term future?"
10. "If we’re doing a great job in our marriage, what will we be doing differently five years from now?"
