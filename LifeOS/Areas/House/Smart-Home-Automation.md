# 🏠 Smart Home Automation
> **Mission**: Delegate the "maintenance of existence" to machines.

## 🧹 Cleaning Automation
*   **Robotic Vacuum/Mop**:
    *   **Strategy**: Schedule to run *during* school runs or deep work blocks.
    *   **Maintenance**: Empty bin daily (habit stack with morning coffee).
    *   **Recommended**: Roborock or Roomba series with mapping.
*   **Air Quality**:
    *   **Strategy**: Smart air purifiers in bedrooms/study areas.
    *   **Trigger**: Auto-on when AQI drops (cooking, pollen).

## 🌡️ Climate & Environment
*   **Smart Thermostat**:
    *   **Strategy**: "Sleep" profile for cooler nights (better sleep hygiene), "Wake" profile to warm up before alarm.
    *   **Energy**: Auto-Eco mode when family phones leave the geofence.
*   **Lighting**:
    *   **Circadian Rhythm**: Warm/dim lights auto-trigger at 8:00 PM to signal "Wind Down" mode for kids.
    *   **Security**: "Away" mode randomizes lights when house is empty.

## 📦 Inventory & Kitchen
*   **Digital Pantry**:
    *   **App**: Grocy (Self-hosted Linux) or FamilyWall.
    *   **Workflow**: Scan barcode upon use.
    *   **Auto-List**: Items added to shopping list automatically when low.
*   **Smart Appliances**:
    *   **Slow Cooker/Instant Pot**: Prep in morning, auto-start for 6:00 PM dinner readiness.

## 🤖 Integration Hub
*   **Home Assistant (Linux)**:
    *   *Advanced*: Run Home Assistant on a local Linux server/Pi.
    *   *Benefit*: Unifies all devices (lights, vacuum, climate) into one privacy-focused dashboard.
    *   *Action*: [ ] Research Home Assistant installation on current Linux rig.

## 🎬 Home Theater & Media
*   **Media Server**:
    *   **Plex / Jellyfin**: Self-hosted media library on Linux server.
    *   *Benefit*: Centralized movie/TV collection, accessible on all devices.
*   **Smart Integration**:
    *   **Automation**: "Movie Mode" scene - dims lights, closes blinds, turns on TV/Soundbar.

## 🌐 Home Networking & Infrastructure
*   **Network Core**:
    *   **Pi-hole / AdGuard Home**: Network-wide ad blocking (runs on Linux/Pi).
    *   **VPN**: WireGuard for secure remote access to home network (access files/cameras from anywhere).
*   **Server Functions (Self-Hosted)**:
    *   **Docker**: Containerize all services (Home Assistant, Grocy, Plex) for easy management.
    *   **Nextcloud**: Private "Google Drive" replacement for family photos and file sharing.
    *   **Paperless-ngx**: Digitize and index household paper documents (bills, medical records).
