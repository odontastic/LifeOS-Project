# House

## Standard
- **Kitchen**: "Clean as you go" - no visual chaos.
- **Maintenance**: Proactive fixes before they become "wife's anxiety."
- **Order**: A place for everything, and everything in its place.

## Why It Matters
A chaotic environment triggers wife's anxiety and signals instability. Order is an act of love.

## Recurring Responsibilities
- [ ] Daily: Kitchen shutdown
- [ ] Weekly: Trash/Recycling
- [ ] Monthly: Maintenance check
