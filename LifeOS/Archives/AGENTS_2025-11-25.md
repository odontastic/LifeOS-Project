# AGENT GUIDANCE for LifeOS Repository

This document outlines key information for AI agents working within the LifeOS personal knowledge management system.

## 1. Project Overview

The LifeOS is a personal operating system designed to manage daily focus, tasks, emotional intelligence, personal growth, and system development. It heavily utilizes a linked markdown structure to organize information and workflows.

## 2. Codebase Structure (Conceptual)

The system is organized into several key conceptual directories, primarily focused on various aspects of personal management. While the physical file structure may be nested, the logical grouping is as follows:

- **GTD-Tasks**: Inbox, next actions, needs processing.
- **Projects**: Active, someday, completed initiatives.
- **Areas**: Broader life domains like Personal-Reflection, Family, Faith, House, Tech.
- **System**: Core system documentation, guides, queries, commands, templates, and AI integration.
- **Resources**: General knowledge base.
- **Archives**: Historical data.

Key files and their roles:
- `00 Start Here`: The main dashboard and entry point.
- `MASTER_PLAN`: High-level system development plan.
- `VISUAL_GUIDE`: Visual representation of the system.
- `COMMAND_MENU`: Centralized list of commands.
- `LifeOS_AI_Integration_Guide`: AI-specific guidance.

## 3. Essential Commands & Workflows

Given the nature of this system as a personal knowledge base, "commands" often refer to navigation, query execution, or prompt invocation.

### Quick Actions
- `⚡ Quick Wins (Low Energy)`: Linked via `[[System/Queries/quick-wins]]`
- `💻 Computer Tasks`: Linked via `[[System/Queries/computer-actions]]`
- `📋 Active Projects`: Linked via `[[System/Queries/active-projects]]`

### System Commands
- `🎮 Command Menu`: Accessible via `[[System/COMMAND_MENU]]`
- `🚀 Quick Reference Guide`: Accessible via `[[QUICK_REFERENCE]]`
- `[Crisis]` for relationship support (Emergency command).

### AI Prompts
The system defines several key AI prompts for daily routines and reviews:
- `[Daily]` Morning Calibration
- `[Solicitude]` Solicitude Check
- `[Examen]` Evening Reflection
- `[Review]` Weekly Review

Refer to `[[System/LifeOS_AI_Integration_Guide]]` and `[[System/Documentation/Automation_Setup_Guide]]` for more details on AI and automation.

## 4. Naming Conventions & Style

- **Markdown-centric**: The primary "code" is markdown files.
- **CamelCase/Kebab-case for file/directory names**: Examples like `Solicitude-Practice`, `GTD-Tasks`, `Personal-Reflection`.
- **Linked References**: Extensive use of `[[Link To File]]` syntax for navigation and cross-referencing.
- **Clear Headings**: Documents use markdown headings (`#`, `##`, etc.) for structure.
- **Tags**: Markdown files often include YAML frontmatter with `tags`.

## 5. Testing & Verification

The system appears to rely on routine "checks" and "reviews" rather than automated software tests. This includes daily emotion checks, solicitude practice logs, and weekly reviews. Agents should be aware that verification in this context means checking for completeness of tasks, adherence to virtues, and personal reflection outcomes.
