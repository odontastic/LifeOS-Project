# Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) Techniques

## 1. Cognitive Restructuring
Cognitive restructuring is a core technique in CBT that involves identifying and challenging negative or irrational thoughts (cognitive distortions).

**How it works:**
1.  **Identify the negative thought:** Become aware of the automatic thoughts that lead to negative emotions.
2.  **Challenge the thought:** Question the evidence for and against the thought. Ask yourself if there are alternative explanations.
3.  **Replace the thought:** Replace the irrational thought with a more balanced and realistic one.

## 2. Behavioral Activation
Behavioral activation is a technique used to overcome procrastination and avoidance by scheduling and engaging in positive activities, even when you don't feel motivated.

**How it works:**
1.  **Identify activities:** Make a list of activities that you enjoy or that give you a sense of accomplishment.
2.  **Schedule activities:** Plan to do these activities at specific times.
3.  **Follow through:** Engage in the activities, regardless of your mood.
