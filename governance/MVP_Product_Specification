description: >
  Authoritative MVP-level product specification for Life OS.
  Defines the problem space, user boundaries, feature scope, success criteria,
  data retention rules, and AI behavior constraints required to validate the
  core hypothesis of context-aware, constrained AI coaching.
document_role: >
  This document is the primary governance and validation contract for the Life OS MVP.
  It constrains system behavior, enforces scope boundaries, defines audit procedures,
  and serves as the reference standard for Supervisor Agent enforcement and backend
  sanity checks during development.

# 🎯 Life OS: Final MVP Product Specification

## 1. Vision & Goals (The Why)

### Problem Statement

Busy, analytical, system‑building individuals struggle with three interlocking failures:

1. **Context Fragmentation**: Personal data, insights, and intentions scattered across tools and memory.
2. **Reflection Gap**: Inconsistent self‑awareness despite valuing growth, meaning, and improvement.
3. **Action Paralysis**: Over‑analysis and system‑building used as avoidance instead of execution.

**Core Insight**: The failure is not tooling but **integration with guardrails**. People need context‑aware guidance that connects daily actions to values without overwhelming or replacing their agency.

---

### Target User

**Primary Persona: The Analytical Architect**

* Analytical, framework‑driven (e.g. INTP‑like)
* Values evidence, structure, and coherence
* Struggles with emotional intelligence, relationships, and consistent execution
* Balances multiple life domains (family, health, work, spiritual life)
* Known failure mode: building ever‑more complex systems instead of acting

---

### Core Value Proposition

Life OS is a **constrained personal operating system** that combines:

* **Second Brain**: PARA‑informed knowledge organization
* **Daily Coach**: Context‑aware, pattern‑grounded guidance
* **Relationship Support**: Reflection and coaching for emotional intelligence
* **Spiritual Companion**: Values‑aligned reflection (Catholic‑compatible, not doctrinal)

**Differentiator**: Life OS adapts to *the user’s actual data and patterns* while remaining deliberately limited. It explains the “why,” nudges the “next step,” and never replaces decision‑making.

---

### Behavioral Non‑Goals (Critical)

Life OS explicitly does **not**:

* Act as a therapist or moral authority
* Decide goals, priorities, or values for the user
* Optimize across conflicting life domains
* Provide prescriptive life decisions
* Remember or surface data without user consent

> Life OS supports judgment. It does not substitute for it.

---

## 2. Success Metrics (MVP Validation)

### Primary Metrics

* 40–50 beta users within 6 weeks
* ≥70% weekly Daily Check‑In completion
* ≥60% of users act on at least one proactive nudge per week

### Secondary Indicators

* ≥30% reduction in time from insight to action
* Monthly self‑report of “feeling less overwhelmed”
* Weekly reflection completion ≥60%

### Kill Metric (Existential Falsifier)

If users report **increased cognitive burden or overwhelm after two weeks**, the MVP is considered failed and must be simplified or halted.

---

## 3. Core MVP Features

### Architectural Loop

**Input → Context → Insight → Nudge → Reflection**

All features must reinforce this loop without expanding scope.

---

### In‑Scope Features

#### F‑1 Secure Authentication

* Firebase Auth (email/password, optional Google)
* Baseline trust and privacy

#### F‑2 Structured Daily Check‑In

* Default: 1 per day
* User‑modifiable at any time
* AI may *suggest* frequency changes but may not auto‑change

**Fields**:

* Mood (1–5)
* Energy (1–5)
* Domain ratings (Family, Health, Work, Spiritual: 1–3)
* ONE Thing completed (Y/N)
* Optional one‑sentence reflection (encrypted)

---

#### F‑3 Context‑Aware Chat (Aura)

Aura is a **Socratic coaching interface**, not a general chatbot.

**Context Includes**:

* Recent check‑ins (subject to Context Decay)
* User values and consent flags
* Active Projects (PARA)
* Recent conversation history

**Constraints**:

* Questions before advice
* Framework‑grounded (CBT, GTD, 7 Habits)
* No invented data
* Escalation language when distress is detected

---

#### F‑4 Proactive Nudge Engine

Context‑triggered prompts designed to reduce avoidance and restore momentum.

**Rules**:

* Max 1 nudge/day, 3/week
* Nudges pause after 3 ignored prompts
* All nudges logged with acknowledgement state

---

#### F‑5 Weekly Review

Guided 10–15 minute reflection:

* Visual summaries (mood/energy)
* Pattern recognition (AI‑assisted)
* Structured questions
* ONE Thing selection

Output saved as timestamped archive entry.

---

#### F‑6 PARA Dashboard

* Projects: Active / On Hold / Archived
* Areas: Core life domains
* Resources: Notes, insights
* Archives: Completed or dormant material

**Attention Rule**: Only Active Projects are included in AI context or nudging.

---

## 4. Data Retention & Memory Lifecycle

### Memory States

* **Active**: Included in AI context
* **Archived**: Stored, searchable, not proactive
* **Dormant**: Excluded from AI context unless requested
* **Deleted**: Permanently removed

---

### Context Decay (Default‑On)

Context Decay controls **AI visibility**, not storage.

**Default Settings**:

* N = 180 days
* AND‑logic exclusion:

  * Entry age > N days
  * Entry not accessed in last N days

**Access Includes**:

* Viewed by user
* Referenced in chat
* Included in weekly review
* Explicitly retrieved at user request

---

### User Overrides

* Time‑range requests override decay
* Entry‑level pinning:

  * Always available
  * Never available unless requested
* Global settings:

  * 30 / 90 / 180 / 365 days
  * Never decay

---

### Supervisor Enforcement

* No silent recall of decayed data
* Disclosure when expanding context
* Summary‑first retrieval if overload risk exists

---

## 5. Consent & Agency

Stored per user:

* Coaching consent
* Proactive nudges consent
* Pattern analysis consent
* Long‑term memory consent

Features must degrade gracefully when consent is withdrawn.

---

## 6. Supervisor Agent (Hierarchy & Enforcement)

### Authority Stack

1. User
2. Supervisor Agent
3. Functional Agents (Aura, Nudge Engine, etc.)

### Supervisor Powers

* Enforce scope and tone
* Veto prescriptive or moralizing responses
* Force question‑only or reflection‑only modes
* Block out‑of‑scope behavior

### Supervisor Limitations

* Cannot coach or advise
* Cannot redefine user values
* Cannot infer diagnoses

> The Supervisor keeps Life OS small, honest, and safe.

---

## 7. Technical Stack (MVP)

* **Frontend**: React Native (Expo)
* **Backend**: Firebase (Firestore, Auth, Cloud Functions)
* **AI**: Gemini 1.5 Flash (fallback GPT‑4o‑mini)
* **Security**:

  * Encryption at rest
  * Field‑level encryption for reflections
  * Strict security rules

---

## 8. Risks & Mitigation

* AI overreach → Supervisor veto + constraints
* User overwhelm → Kill metric + nudging limits
* Scope creep → Strict out‑of‑scope enforcement
* Privacy breach → Encryption + audits

---

## 9. Audit Usage Guide 🔦

**When**:

* Before adding features
* After user confusion or distress
* Weekly sprint review

**How**:

1. Re‑read Vision & Non‑Goals
2. Check Out‑of‑Scope list
3. Validate Supervisor enforcement
4. Compare backend behavior to spec

**Red Flags**:

* Increasing verbosity
* Moral language
* New frameworks appearing
* User asking “What should I do?” and receiving direct answers

If violated, cut features before adding safeguards.

---

## 10. MVP Validation Criteria

The MVP is validated if:

* ≥40 weekly active users
* ≥70% weekly check‑in rate
* ≥80% AI insights rated helpful
* <5% week‑one churn

If not, simplify ruthlessly.

---

## Final Principle

Life OS is an experiment in **constrained intelligence**.

If a feature does not help the user take a meaningful step *today*, it does not belong in the MVP.
