# Emotional Intelligence Mastery

## Objective
Develop the capacity to recognize my own emotions, accurately read my wife's emotional state, and respond with empathy rather than defensiveness.

## Why It Matters
My "lack of care/emotion" and "inability to recognize faults" are the core threats to my marriage. Improving EQ is the only way to bridge the gap with my wife's high standards and risk aversion.

## Core Skills to Build
1.  **Self-Awareness**: "What am I feeling right now?" (Naming the affect).
2.  **Attunement**: "What is she feeling right now?" (Perception checking).
3.  **Translation**: Reframing her "standards" as "safety needs" and her "risk aversion" as "protection."
4.  **Repair**: Admitting fault quickly and specifically without shame spirals.

## Milestones
- [ ] Create "Wife Translator" Guide (Understanding the 'Why' behind her actions)
- [ ] Complete 7 consecutive days of "Emotion Spotting" in Daily Journal
- [ ] Successfully de-escalate one conflict using "Attunement" instead of logic
