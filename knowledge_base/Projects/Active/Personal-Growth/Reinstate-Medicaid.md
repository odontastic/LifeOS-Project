# Reinstate California Medicaid (Medi-Cal)

## Objective
**Secure active Medi-Cal coverage** to ensure medical safety for hormone monitoring and general health, and to relieve the financial "existential threat" anxiety for the family.

## Why It Matters
- **Safety**: You are on hormones and aging; you need medical oversight.
- **Trust**: This proves to your wife you are taking responsibility for your own safety.
- **Finance**: Protects the family from medical bankruptcy.
- **Mental Health**: Covers therapy, which is critical for the gender/identity crisis.

## Milestones
- [ ] **Gather Documentation**: ID, SSN, Income proofs, Residency proof.
- [ ] **Submit Application**: Via BenefitsCal.com or phone/mail.
- [ ] **Confirm Receipt**: Verify the county has the application.
- [ ] **Active Coverage**: Receive confirmation of reinstatement.

## Critical Info
- **Website**: [BenefitsCal.com](https://benefitscal.com/)
- **Phone**: 1-800-541-5555 (Medi-Cal Member Helpline) or local county office.
- **Timeline**:
  - If lapsed < 90 days: Reinstatement possible.
