## Project Title: Pool Pump Leak Diagnosis
## Project ID: PPLD-001
## Category: Pool Maintenance
## Status: Active
## Priority: High

## Project Description
- **Objective**: Conduct comprehensive diagnostic investigation of pool pump area leaks to identify all leak sources and develop repair plan
- **Scope**: Complete system inspection, document leak locations, assess repair priorities, coordinate remediation with related projects
- **Deliverables**: Complete leak assessment report, repair priority matrix, comprehensive repair plan, preventive monitoring system
- **Background**: Initial assessment identified Jandy valve leak; further investigation needed for complete system diagnosis

## Project Goals
- **Primary Goals**: Complete full pump area inspection, document all leak locations and severity, develop prioritized repair plan
- **Secondary Goals**: Implement preventive monitoring measures, coordinate with related equipment maintenance projects

## Current Status
- **Start Date**: 2025-11-11
- **End Date**: 2025-11-20
- **Progress**: 25%
- **Blockers**: None identified

## Next Actions
