Tiago Forte is best known for popularizing the concept and methodology of Building a Second Brain (BASB). This is his biggest contribution to personal knowledge management (PKM).
The Methodology
People commonly refer to his work as Building a Second Brain (or the acronym BASB). Within this overarching system, there are two core frameworks he developed and labeled:
PARA Method: This is his organizational system, an acronym for Projects, Areas, Resources, and Archives. This system provides a universal structure for organizing all digital information (notes, files, tasks, etc.) across different platforms and apps.
CODE Framework: This is the four-step process for working with information within the "second brain" system, which stands for Capture, Organize, Distill, and Express.
In essence, BASB is the entire methodology or philosophy for using an external digital system to store and leverage knowledge, while PARA is the specific organizational structure and CODE is the process for making it work effectively.
