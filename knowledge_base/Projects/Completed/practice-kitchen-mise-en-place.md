# Practice Kitchen Mise-en-place

## Action
Cook dinner tonight using the "Clean as you go" method. Ensure the sink is organized *before* sitting down to eat.

## Why It Matters
To reduce wife's anxiety and demonstrate "Compassionate Firmness" (firmness with myself to maintain order).

## Next Steps
1. Empty dishwasher before cooking.
2. Wash tools immediately after use.
3. Stack dirty dishes neatly if they can't be washed immediately.
