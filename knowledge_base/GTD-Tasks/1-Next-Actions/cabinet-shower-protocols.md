# Cabinet & Shower Shutdown Protocols

## Action
Implement two simple shutdown checklists to reduce wife's mental load and build trust.

## Why It Matters
These "small things" are not small to her. They signal whether I'm paying attention to details that matter to her. Every open cabinet or forgotten sprayer confirms her fear: "I'm alone in maintaining order."

## The Protocols

### 1. Kitchen/Room Exit Protocol
**Before leaving ANY room:**
- [ ] Scan left-to-right for open cabinets
- [ ] Scan left-to-right for open drawers
- [ ] Close anything open
- **Time**: 10 seconds

### 2. Shower Exit Protocol
**Last actions before exiting shower:**
- [ ] Deactivate hand sprayer (switch back to shower head)
- [ ] Check shower curtain is inside tub
- [ ] Quick floor check (no water outside tub)
- **Time**: 15 seconds

## Implementation Intention

**IF** I'm about to leave the kitchen/bathroom,  
**THEN** I will pause and scan for open cabinets/sprayer position.

## Make Successes Visible

**After completing protocol, casually mention:**
- "Cabinets are closed" (as I leave kitchen)
- "Shower's all set" (as I leave bathroom)

**Why**: Gives her brain positive data points, reduces her need to check, shows I'm thinking about her needs.

## Habit Tracking

Track daily in journal:
- [ ] Mon - Kitchen protocol / Shower protocol
- [ ] Tue - Kitchen protocol / Shower protocol
- [ ] Wed - Kitchen protocol / Shower protocol
- [ ] Thu - Kitchen protocol / Shower protocol
- [ ] Fri - Kitchen protocol / Shower protocol
- [ ] Sat - Kitchen protocol / Shower protocol
- [ ] Sun - Kitchen protocol / Shower protocol

## Next Steps

1. Print this and tape to bathroom mirror (visual reminder)
2. Set phone reminder for first week: "Shutdown protocols?"
3. Practice until automatic (estimated 21-30 days)
