# Refine John's Homeschool Routine

**Goal:** Answer the following questions to finalize the daily structure and schedule for John's homeschooling.

## Questions to Answer
1.  **Pacing:** When he's working on a project he enjoys, does he prefer to work in a long, deep, uninterrupted block of time (e.g., 2 hours), or does he work better in shorter bursts, switching between subjects?
2.  **Activation:** How much "activation energy" does he need from you to start a task? Does he self-start on projects that interest him, or does he generally need a prompt to begin?
3.  **Instruction Style:** Does he learn a concept better if you start with a real-world, hands-on application (Concrete) and then explain the theory, or start with the theory (Abstract) and then apply it?
4.  **Reaction to Struggle:** When he gets stuck, does he tend to shut down/quit, or does he dig in and treat it like a puzzle?
5.  **Interdisciplinary:** Does he get excited when he sees connections between subjects (e.g., History + Physics), or does he prefer to keep them separate?

**Next Step:** Once answered, update [[Areas/Family/homeschooling_6th_grade]] with the defined daily structure.
