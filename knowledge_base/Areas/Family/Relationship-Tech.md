# ❤️ Relationship Engineering
> **Mission**: Use structure to create safety, predictability, and connection.

## 📅 The Shared Brain (Calendar)
*   **Platform**: Google Calendar (synced to phones).
*   **Layers**:
    *   **Family**: Hard landscape (School, Doctors, Trips).
    *   **Menu**: Dinner plans (prevents "What's for dinner?" stress).
    *   **Finance**: Bill due dates.
*   **Rule**: "If it's not on the calendar, it doesn't exist."
    *   *Benefit*: Removes the mental load from your wife to "remind" you.

## 🗺️ The Love Map Database
*   **Concept**: A digital repository of her preferences, dreams, and inner world.
*   **Tool**: Simple Note in Obsidian/LifeOS or dedicated app (Evernote).
*   **Data Points**:
    *   *Coffee Order*: Exact specs.
    *   *Sizes*: Clothing, rings, shoes.
    *   *Favorites*: Flowers, colors, authors, comfort movies.
    *   *Triggers*: What stresses her out? (Avoid these).
    *   *Dreams*: What is she currently hoping for?

## 💬 Communication Protocols
*   **Check-In App**:
    *   **Couples App**: **Paired** or **Agapé**.
    *   *Function*: Daily question prompts to spark non-logistical conversation.
*   **The "Heads Up" Text**:
    *   *Automation*: If leaving location "Home" > Send text "Heading out".
    *   *Manual*: Text when leaving an appointment. "On my way, ETA 15 mins." (Builds trust).

## 📸 Digital Memories
*   **Google Photos**:
    *   *Action*: Create a "Best of Us" album.
    *   *Usage*: Cast to TV during dinner for positive nostalgia.
