# Your 90-Day Daily Tracker and Practical Tools

## Quick Reference: What to Do When...

### When You Feel Triggered or Withdrawn
1. **STOP** (literally pause)
2. **Body Scan** (90 seconds - see where the tension is)
3. **Defuse** (name the thought: "I'm having the thought that...")
4. **Breathe** (6-count exhale to activate parasympathetic nervous system)
5. **Approach** (re-enter the conversation with vulnerability)

### When Your Wife Expresses an Emotion
**Don't:**
- Immediately offer solutions
- Intellectualize ("That's not logical because...")
- Minimize ("You're overreacting")
- Withdraw ("I don't understand")

**Do:**
- Pause and take one deep breath
- Make soft eye contact
- Ask: "Tell me more. What do you need from me right now?"
- Listen for 5+ minutes without interrupting
- Reflect: "What I'm hearing is... Is that right?"

### When Your Son Shares a Struggle
**Don't:**
- Jump to fixing it
- Compare it to your experience ("When I was your age...")
- Dismiss it as small ("You'll get over it")
- Give a lecture

**Do:**
- Sit at eye level with him
- Ask: "How are you feeling about that?"
- Share vulnerability: "When I faced something similar, I felt..."
- Ask: "What do you think you need right now?"
- Offer: "I'm here with you"

## Emergency Practices (When You're Triggered)

### The 60-Second Nervous System Reset

When you feel the urge to withdraw, intellectualize, or defend:

1. **Seconds 0-10:** Deep breathing (4 in, 6 out)
2. **Seconds 10-30:** Body scan (where's the sensation?)
3. **Seconds 30-45:** Name the sensation ("my chest is tight")
4. **Seconds 45-60:** Ask yourself: "What am I actually afraid of right now?" (say it aloud if alone)
5. **After 60 seconds:** Return to your family with: "I felt something come up. Give me a moment. I want to be present for you."

### The Shame Activation Protocol

When you feel "not good enough" or want to hide:

1. **Pause** - Notice the shame feeling
2. **Name it** - "I'm experiencing shame right now"
3. **Reach out** - Tell your wife or a trusted friend: "I'm feeling ashamed right now"
4. **Speak it** - Say what the shame is saying: "I feel like I'm failing at this" or "I feel like I should know this already"
5. **Receive** - Let someone respond with empathy (this is the antidote to shame)

4. **What did I learn about my wife or sons that surprised me?**
5. **Which virtue did I practice most: humility, patience, or charity?**

## Advanced Tracking (Days 60+): The Attachment Security Indicator

Once you're 60 days in, track these observable shifts:

**In Your Wife:**
- Does she initiate emotional conversation?
- Does she share vulnerabilities more easily?
- Does she initiate physical affection?
- Does she defend you to others?
- Does she relax in your presence?

**In Your Sons:**
- Do they share problems (not just facts)?
- Do they seek your advice on relational issues?
- Do they model your behavior?
- Do they seem more secure/calm?
- Do they initiate time with you?

**In Yourself:**
- Do you reach for presence before withdrawal?
- Does emotional language come more easily?
- Do you feel less reactive/defensive?
- Do you notice your body's signals earlier?
- Does vulnerability feel less terrifying?

**You are doing it.**
