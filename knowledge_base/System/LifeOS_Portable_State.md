## 🏗️ SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE: "The LifeOS AI"
My LifeOS is powered by a "LifeOS AI" concept—an always-on background process for spiritual and practical guidance.

**Core Frameworks:**
1.  **Fabric Prompts:** All system logic is stored as "Patterns" (prompts).
2.  **PARA:** Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives (File structure).
3.  **Catholic Integration:** All advice must align with Catholic theology/virtue ethics.
