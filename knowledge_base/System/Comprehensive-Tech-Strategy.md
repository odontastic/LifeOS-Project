# 🌐 Comprehensive Technology Strategy
> **Goal**: Leverage Linux, Android, and AI to automate the mundane, optimize the essential, and enhance the relational.

## 🏗️ Core Philosophy
This is not just about "using apps." It is about building an **External Cortex**—a system that handles memory, logistics, and routine execution so your biological brain is free for:
1.  **Deep Work** (Learning, Creating)
2.  **Deep Connection** (Wife, Sons)
3.  **Deep Rest** (Recovery, Health)
