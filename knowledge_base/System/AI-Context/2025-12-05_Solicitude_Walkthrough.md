# LifeOS Refactoring & Solicitude Program Walkthrough

## 🚀 Mission Accomplished
I have successfully refactored your LifeOS file structure and implemented the **"Engineering of Empathy"** Solicitude Program.

## 🏗️ Structural Changes
1.  **Consolidation**: `Resources/00_System` has been merged into `System/`. All system files (prompts, templates) are now in one place.
2.  **Organization**: `Areas/` is now clean. Loose files have been moved to:
    -   `Areas/House/`
    -   `Areas/Family/`
    -   `Areas/Personal-Reflection/`
    -   `Areas/Tech/`
3.  **Cleanup**: `Dashboard.md` (duplicate) was removed. `00-Start-Here.md` is the single source of truth.
4.  **Metadata**: All files now have standardized YAML frontmatter with `type`, `status`, and `up` links for hierarchy.

## ❤️ The Engineering of Empathy Program
Located in `Areas/Family/Solicitude-Practice/`, this program is designed for your analytical mind.

### The Modules
1.  **[[Areas/Family/Solicitude-Practice/00-Program-Overview|Program Overview]]**: The manifesto. "Solicitude is an architecture of care."
2.  **[[Areas/Family/Solicitude-Practice/Module-1-Theology|Module 1: Theology]]**: Re-framing "Original Solitude" as an asset.
3.  **[[Areas/Family/Solicitude-Practice/Module-2-Psychology|Module 2: Psychology]]**: The Gottman ATTUNE framework as an algorithm.
4.  **[[Areas/Family/Solicitude-Practice/Module-3-Habits|Module 3: Habits]]**: The "Tiny Habits" code for daily life.
5.  **[[Areas/Family/Solicitude-Practice/Log|Daily Log]]**: Track your 20:1 ratio.

### Dashboard Integration
Your `00-Start-Here.md` dashboard now features:
-   **Daily Motto**: A section for daily inspiration (Bold & Unpredictable).
-   **Active Workflow**: Direct links to the Solicitude program.

## 🗺️ Visualizing the System
I created **[[Areas/Family/Solicitude-Practice/Visual-Map|The Architecture of Care]]**, a visual graph showing how Theology, Psychology, and Habits feed into the virtue of Solicitude.

## 🤖 AI Coaching
I created `System/Prompts/solicitude-check.md`. You can now ask the AI:
> "Run the Solicitude Check."

It will:
1.  **Surprise You**: Generate a bold, witty, or firm motto.
2.  **Check Data**: Review your 20:1 log.
3.  **Challenge You**: Assign a specific micro-habit.

## 🔗 Semantic Linking
I ran a script to:
-   Fix broken links from the move.
-   Standardize all file metadata.
-   Ensure every file links up to its parent.

Your system is now cleaner, faster, and optimized for both **productivity** and **love**.
