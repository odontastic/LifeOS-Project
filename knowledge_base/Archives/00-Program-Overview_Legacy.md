# The Engineering of Empathy: A Systems Approach to Solicitude

> "Solicitude is not a feeling; it is an architecture of care."

## 🎯 Mission
To operationalize the virtue of **Solicitude** (active, anxious care) by bridging the gap between analytical cognition and relational presence. This program treats empathy not as a mystical trait but as a **skill stack** that can be engineered, practiced, and mastered.

## 📐 Core Axioms
1.  **Original Solitude is an Asset**: Your capacity for deep, isolated thought is the *engine* of your care, not its enemy. We will redirect that processing power outward.
2.  **Love is Attention**: In a finite world, the allocation of attention is the ultimate currency of love.
3.  **Systems Beat Willpower**: We do not rely on "feeling" loving; we build protocols that *generate* loving actions.
