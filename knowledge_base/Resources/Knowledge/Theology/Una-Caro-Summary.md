# Una Caro (One Flesh): In Praise of Monogamy
**Source**: Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith
**Topic**: The Value of Marriage as an Exclusive Union

## 1. Unity and Exclusivity as the Foundation
The foundational property of authentic marriage is **unity** (*Una Caro*).
*   **Exclusive Bond**: A totalizing relationship that **cannot be shared**. This unity makes the bond indissoluble.
*   **God's Plan**: Not a cultural construct, but a response to human nature and God's original plan.
*   **Against Relativism**: Contrasts with polygamy/polyamory, which offer only a **partial gift of self**.

## 2. Mutual Belonging and Self-Giving
**Mutual belonging** is not possession but a reciprocal gift.
*   **The "We"**: A profound reciprocity (*los dos*) encompassing shared desires and struggles.
*   **Delicate Care**: Requires a **"holy fear of profaning the freedom of the other."** Neither spouse is an object.
*   **Conjugal Charity**: The "greatest friendship" nurtured by divine grace.

## 3. Defense of Human Dignity
Monogamy upholds the equal dignity of spouses.
*   **Dignity of Women**: Protects women from being dishonored or relativized. Implies **exclusive reciprocity**.
*   **Co-Subject of Love**: The spouse is loved as a subject, not an object of use.

## 4. A Path to Fulfillment and Grace
Monogamy is a path to fulfillment, not a burden.
*   **Openness to Eternity**: A love that opens to eternity through the Sacrament.
*   **Social Responsibility**: Inspires charity and openness to the world (fruitfulness).
*   **New Pedagogy**: A call to present the grandeur of exclusive love to a "culture of temporariness."

**Relevance to Solicitude**:
This document reinforces the "Theological Framework" of the Solicitude Mastery Protocol. Specifically, the concept of **"Delicate Care"** aligns perfectly with the definition of Solicitude as "anxious care" for the other.
