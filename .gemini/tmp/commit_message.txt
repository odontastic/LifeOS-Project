feat: Implement authentication, authorization, and rate limiting

This commit introduces a foundational authentication and authorization system using JWT, SQLCipher (planned, but currently blocked), and Argon2ID hashing.

Key changes include:
- **Authentication & Authorization:** Implemented JWT-based authentication using OAuth2 standards. A new `auth.py` module handles user management (SQLite DB), password hashing with Argon2ID, JWT generation/verification, and FastAPI security dependencies.
- **User Management:** Added `/register` and `/token` endpoints to `main.py` for user registration and login, with basic password strength checks and comprehensive logging.
- **Protected Routes:** All sensitive API endpoints (`/api/ingest`, `/api/query`, `/api/flows/*`, `/api/feedback`, `/api/metrics`) are now protected by authentication.
- **Rate Limiting:** Integrated `fastapi-limiter` to implement Redis-based rate limiting on the `/token` endpoint (5 attempts/minute) to prevent brute-force attacks.
- **Security Enhancements:** Switched password hashing from Bcrypt to Argon2ID for improved security.
- **Documentation:** Updated `docs/01_LifeOS_Master_Plan.md`, `System/AI-Context/Next-Gen_AI_Workflows.md`, and `docs/03_Architecture_Decisions.md` to reflect the "Inner Palette" and "Emotion Engine" plan.
- **Software Stack Assessment:** Conducted a comprehensive audit of the software stack for security, privacy, licensing, and Android portability, identifying key strengths, weaknesses, and licensing conflicts (Neo4j, Redis, SQLCipher).

**Note on SQLCipher:** Implementation of SQLCipher for SQLite encryption is currently blocked as it requires system-level SQLCipher development libraries to be installed, which is an external dependency. This will be addressed in a future session.
