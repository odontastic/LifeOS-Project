## High‑Level Summary

1. **Emotional awareness** is modeled through the *Therapeutic Graph* with nodes such as `Emotion`, `Belief`, `Trigger`, and `CopingMechanism`.  Bridging rules convert journal insights into actionable Zettels and Tasks.
2. **Marriage dynamics** are emphasized in the Personal Growth System and scientific foundation sections, highlighting the importance of emotional availability, secure attachment, and shared practices (e.g., daily check‑ins, vulnerability exercises).
3. **PKM integration** connects these insights to the PARA/GTD/Zettelkasten layers, enabling the system to surface relevant Zettels, create Projects from emotional patterns, and schedule Tasks for relationship work.
